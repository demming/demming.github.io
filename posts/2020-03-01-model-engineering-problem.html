<h1 id="model-engineering-problem">Model Engineering Problem</h1>
<p>As an appetizer, a simplistic real-world engineering problem. Imagine TODO harmonic oscillator …</p>
<p>A very simple numerical method for solving an <em>initial value problem</em> (IVP), the explicit Euler’s method, can be invoked to solve our problem at hand.</p>
<p>In terms of the symplectic Hamiltonian dynamics this problem can be formulated as … TODO</p>
<p>This is a very simplified nonlinear TODO model neglecting any dissipative forces such as friction.</p>
<p>The general solution is TODO</p>
<p>A well-known exact solution is … TODO</p>
<p>How would we deal with it had we not known the exact closed-form solution? Well, first of all, what do we want to learn about it? It could be, in principle,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the long-term behavior of the described mechanical system,</li>
<li>the estimation of certain bounds in which the solution is still reasonable,</li>
<li>the evaluation of the solution at particular points.</li>
</ol>
<p>After all, we might be wrong with our model as applied to the real-world phenomenon.</p>
<p>A large issue is the quality of the numerical solution, i.e., it’s adherence to the exact solution, if the problem is well-posed in the first place. In reality, when we don’t know the exact solution, how do we know that the numerical solution actually represents well the exact one? What if there are many wild fluctuations or any other sorts of behavior of the exact solution that may make the numerical result seem questionable? As noted, in most cases we don’t have an easily computable representation for the exact solution. So we must find a way to assert the quality of the numerical solution, in general!</p>
<p>Using this mechanical system as our epitome, we will step-by-step develop an entire family of composite numerical schemes, of whose quality we can be certain, at the same time being very efficient!</p>
<p>In this case the known exact solution will be our guiding benchmark. Regardless, we will establish theorems that guarantee the high quality of the solution and efficiency of the method. Our <strong>goal</strong> hence will be to get as close to the exact solution from the data as possible, within an acceptable margin of error, while maintaining overall computational efficiency.</p>
<p>Here’s a comparison with the benchmark. [ ] TODO: plots of several methods for the computation of the orbit.</p>
